# Univestal

## Overview
Univestal is a financial literacy app designed for high school students. It provides an interactive trading simulator, educational content on investing, live asset updates, and relevant financial news to help teens understand investing, compound interest, and real-world financial concepts.

## Features
- Trading simulator with real-time stock data
- Educational modules that address common investing misconceptions
- Personalized portfolios and dashboards to track learning progress
- News and updates on relevant financial markets

## Motivation
I originally built Univestal for my peers who lacked accessible financial education. Many of them had misconceptions or no prior exposure to investing. Univestal helps bridge that gap by combining hands-on learning with live financial data and guidance.
